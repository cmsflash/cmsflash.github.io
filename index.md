# Research Experience

**Visual Embedding of Chinese** at *Computer Vision Group, The University of Hong Kong*

- Sep. 2018 - Present
- Designing a novel model to improve Chinese embedding accuracy by utilizing visual features.
- Developed a PyTorch embedding library. Reduced single-GPU training time from 82 days to 28.1 hours compared to existing open-source implementations.
- Bachelor’s final year project.

**Factorized Attention** at *SenseTime*

- Sep. 2018 - Nov. 2018
- Proposed factorized attention, which reduced the memory and computational complexities of the self-attention mechanism from quadratic to linear and is applicable to computer vision and NLP.
- Achieved new states-of-the-art on object detection (43.1 over 41.8 in AP on MS-COCO 2017) and stereo depth estimation (0.477 over 1.09 in EPE on Scene Flow) and significant improvement on instance seg-mentation (37.9 over 36.6 in AP on MS-COCO 2017).
- Submitted a first-author [paper](#preprint) to a top-tier conference.

**Project on Stereo Depth Estimation** at *SenseTime*

- May 2018 - Aug. 2018
- Developed a stereo depth estimator based on PSMNet with improved training procedures.
- Achieved 2x reduction in error rate (EPE) over the previous state-of-the-art on the Scene Flow dataset.
- Primary contributor.

# Teaching Experience

**Software Engineering**, Teaching Assistant

- Jan. 2019 - May 2019 \(not started)
- To assist George Mitcheson, Guest Lecturer, Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong

# Other Projects

[**BeautyNet**](https://github.com/cms-flash/beauty-net)

- May 2018 - Present
- Developed a PyTorch project template. Applied deduplication, modularization, and a consistent code style to improve maintainability, testability, and analyzability.
- Became 2nd most popular PyTorch template on GitHub, got 180+ stars, and trended for 3 days.
- Owner and primary contributor.
